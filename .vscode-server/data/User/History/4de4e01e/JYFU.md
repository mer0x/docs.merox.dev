#### Connectivity Infrastructure Overview

Gateway to the Internet : The setup begins with a Huawei Optical Network Terminal (ONT) from Orange, in bridge mode, forwarding a public IP address to the pfSense router, marking the gateway to the internet.


#### Core Network Services


###### Security and Management Core


-    **Firewall**: Filters traffic based on security rules.
-    **pfBlockerNG**: Blocks ads and malicious sites üõ°Ô∏è.
-    **DHCP & DNS Services**: Assigns IP addresses and resolves DNS queries, with Unbound as a secondary DNS resolver üîÑ.
-    **Intrusion Detection with Snort**: Monitors for security threats.
-    **Remote Accessibility**: Enabled through WoL and VPNs (IPsec & OpenVPN), offering remote access üåç.

###### VLAN Management
A TP-Link managed switch facilitates VLAN segmentation, with devices organized within **VLAN57** for streamlined network management.


###### Kubernetes and Traefik 

The Kubernetes Ingress Controller, using Traefik, is pivotal for external access management, simplifying service deployment and routing.
