## Configuring Data Sources

2. **Add Data Source**:
   - Click on the **Gear icon** in the sidebar > **Data Sources** > **Add data source**.
   - Select your data source type (e.g., Prometheus, InfluxDB, MySQL).
   - Configure the data source settings specific to your source (URL, database, user, password).

## Creating Dashboards

1. **Create a New Dashboard**:
   - Click the **+ icon** in the sidebar > **Dashboard**.
   - Choose **Add new panel** to start customizing your first panel.

2. **Configure the Panel**:
   - Select the data source from the **Query** tab.
   - Craft your metric query using the query editor.
   - Customize the panel's appearance and settings in the **Panel** and **Visualization** tabs.

3. **Save the Dashboard**:
   - Click the **Save** icon in the top right corner, give your dashboard a name, and click **Save**.

## Best Practices

- **Organize with Folders**: Use folders to organize your dashboards by project, data source, or environment.
- **Template Variables**: Use variables to create more dynamic and interactive dashboards.
- **Alerts Configuration**: Configure alerts to notify you of critical conditions within your data.
- **Regular Backups**: Regularly export and back up your dashboard configurations.
- **Security**: Ensure Grafana is behind a reverse proxy with SSL termination. Use firewall rules to restrict access to the Grafana server.
